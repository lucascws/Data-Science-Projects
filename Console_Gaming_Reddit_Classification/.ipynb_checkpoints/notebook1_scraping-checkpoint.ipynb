    "In this project, the aim is to assist a new gaming store in the setting up of the online forum for the local community by implementing a classification model for them to tag/allocate their post to either 'PS5' or 'Xbox'. To achieve this, we utilise the latest posts from reddit for the respective consoles. In addition, they need insights from the console gaming community to aid in their marketing campaign to determine the focus. From our research, PS5 seems to be have more popular and active community than Xbox. For both consoles, the trending topics are similar. Those topics are their subscription services, PS Plus and Game Pass, the top games as well as the controllers. After performing sentiments and emotions analysis on the reddit posts, games, in general, seems to garner the most positive sentiments. Thus, games could be a focus for a marketing campaign. To classify the post into PS5 and Xbox, we will use a classification model as the variable here is a binary variable. After evaluating the various models, our top three models are Logistic Regression, Light GBM and Random Forest. The Logistic Regression Model was chosen as the best model as it gave the best accuracy score."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A gaming store has been newly set up. The owners wish to build its business activities, and increase its physical and online presences.\n",
    "To start off, they would like to find out which topics of the major consoles (PS5 and Xbox) are trending. At the same time, they are exploring the idea of having a forum on their website that allow discussion among gaming community, and e-commerce section to include product reviews. \n",
    "We are engaged to develop a classification model that predicts which category a post belongs to. This will be helpful for their forum moderation/upkeep while users experience better navigation of the store’s online space with the help of accurate tagging/sections allocation. \n",
    "We are also tasked to identify the recent topics of interest and the community’s sentiments towards them to aid them in their marketing campaign. This would provide them an indicative area of focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, our goal is to: \n",
    "- Identify the hottest topics from the subreddits of PS5 and Xbox Series X\n",
    "- What are general sentiments and emotions of the community in general and towards the topics/products\n",
    "- Develop a Classification Model to distinguish PS5 and Xbox posts\n",
    "    - Our objective is to classify post without the words 'PS5' and 'Xbox' (or similar words) in them as those posts can be automatically tagged/allocated"
